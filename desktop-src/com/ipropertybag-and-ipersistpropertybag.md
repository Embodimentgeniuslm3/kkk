# IPropertyBag and IPersistPropertyBag

[**IPropertyBag**](/previous-versions/windows/internet-explorer/ie-developer/platform-apis/aa768196(v=vs.85)) and [**IPersistPropertyBag**](/previous-versions/windows/internet-explorer/ie-developer/platform-apis/aa768205(v=vs.85)) optimize save as text mechanisms, and therefore are recommended for ActiveX Control containers that implement a save as text mechanism. **IPropertyBag** is implemented by a container, and is roughly analogous to [**IStream**](/windows/desktop/api/objidl/nn-objidl-istream). **IPersistPropertyBag** is implemented by controls, and is roughly analogous to [**IPersistStream**](/windows/desktop/api/ObjIdl/nn-objidl-ipersiststream).
