# Rendering and Layout Changes

Windows Internet Explorer 8 more strictly interprets HTML markup than previous versions, and this change can cause webpages to displaying incorrectly. For example, when a site displays a list or table correctly in Windows Internet Explorer 7, it might appear broken in Internet Explorer 8.

You can resolve these types of issues by reducing the webpage (by using the [website troubleshooting guidance](https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/Project/Download/FileDownload.aspx?ProjectName=IE8&DownloadId=7167) document) to find the malformed HTML. If you fix most display issues, the changes do not create problems in previous versions of Windows Internet Explorer because the previous versions simply ignore the extraneous HTML. For more information about these changes, see the [Site Compatibility and IE8](https://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2009/03/12/site-compatibility-and-ie8.aspx) blog post.
